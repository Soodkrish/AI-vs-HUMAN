# Human vs AI: Analytics and Experiments

This repository explores the differences between human decision-making and AI-driven approaches in various data-focused tasks. It includes real-world projects, analytics, and models designed to test, compare, and evaluate how each performs under different scenarios.

The primary goal is to understand where AI shines, where human intuition still matters, and how both can be used effectively depending on the context.

## Overview

This project includes a range of experiments, with a strong focus on areas like:

- Stock market forecasting and trading strategies
- Sentiment analysis from social media and financial news
- Real-time data analytics
- Model interpretability and result validation

Each project compares AI-generated results with human logic or decision paths. Some are designed to run live, while others use historical data for backtesting and benchmarking.
